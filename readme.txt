Install Facebook Activity Feed widget for your wordpress blog.
== Description ==
The Facebook Activiy application enables visitors to view activity of their friends on Facebook about your site. The activity feed displays stories/pages when users like content on your site through Facebook like button, when users share content on your site in Facebook, and when they comment on a page on your site. If the user is logged into Facebook, the plugin highlights the content from friend's feed. When the user is logged out the activity feed shows recommendations from across the site and gives the user the option to log in to Facebook. The plugin is filled with activity from the user's friends. If there isn't enough friend activity to fill the plugin, it is filled with recommendations.
